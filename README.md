# Hydra.jl

Hydra is a package for flexible and modular dynamic modelling of chemical effects. It aims to facilitate **modular modelling approaches**. <br>
The core of the package is an implementation of a reserveless Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) model, 
which can currently be used for organism-level simulations. Functionality for (agent-based) population modelling is planned to be released soon. <br>
To get started with using Hydra and get a better idea what it is about, see `examples/Tutorial.ipynb`.
