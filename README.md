# Hydra.jl

Hydra is a package for flexible and modular dynamic modelling of chemical effects. <br>
The core of the package is an implementation of a reserveless Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) model, 
which can be used for organism-level simulations via DEBODE and population simulations via DEBABM. <br>
The initial commit provides the raw source code. Examples, tests, and documentation will follow.
